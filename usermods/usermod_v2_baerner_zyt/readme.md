This usermod drives an max 16x16 pixel matrix wordclock with WLED. There are 4 additional dots for the minutes. 

The visualisation is described by 4 masks with LED numbers (single dots for minutes, minutes, hours). 

The index of the LEDs in the masks always starts at 0, even if the ledOffset is not 0.

These are the parameters that controls the behavior in the WLED :
